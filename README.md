# spotiPlayPublic
The objective of the project was to make a music playing application.
In our daily life, music is with us constantly (travel, relaxation, work, parties ...). Nevertheless, we are used to listen to compressed music of lower quality than in the past. Indeed, the streaming platforms (predominant on this market today) are compelled to compress their audio files in order not to overload the servers and the internet connection. But some users want to listen to music in CD quality. That's why we chose to create this application capable of playing high quality files stored locally while keeping the advantages of streaming platforms capable of managing and automatically creating a clean and updated library.
